 * This class is the easiest implementation of a trade object.

 * <p>
 * Instead of widening the access of those classes or recreating them, this class was added to serve a basic trading implementation.
 * To register a trade, just call
 * {@link TradeRegistry#registerVillagerTrade(net.minecraft.world.entity.npc.VillagerProfession, int, VillagerTrades.ItemListing...)}
 * or
 * {@link TradeRegistry#registerTradeForWanderingTrader(boolean, VillagerTrades.ItemListing...)}.

     * @param primaryPrice     The first price a player has to pay to get the 'sale' stack.
     * @param secondaryPrice   An optional, secondary price to pay as well as the primary one. If not needed just use {@link ItemStack#EMPTY}.
     * @param sale             The ItemStack which a player can purchase in exchange for the two prices.
     * @param maxTrades        The amount of trades one villager or wanderer can do. When the amount is surpassed, the trade can't be purchased anymore.
     * @param experiencePoints How much experience points does the player get, when trading. Vanilla uses between 2 and 30 for this.
     * @param priceMultiplier  How much should the price rise, after the trade is used. It is added to the stack size of the primary price. Vanilla uses between 0.05 and 0.2.
